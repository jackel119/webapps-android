\section{Initial Research Motivation and Problem Statement} 

Almost everyone has at least one person who they often share expenses and split bills with - for example, flatmates, significant others, friends and coworkers. Such expenses can range from restaurant meals, grocery shopping, to house bills, etc. It is almost always an inconvenient situation for everyone involved to decide how to deal with said expenses,
Our initial idea is to create an app that helps people with tracking their expenses, specifically with splitting their bills. We then went on to produce some initial research on the this specific idea. We started off by focusing on young professionals that share expenses with their coworkers and friends. We will discuss in detail the process our initial research below.

\section{Identification of Current State}

In the current market, there exists many apps that help people with splitting bills and keeping track of their expenses. However, we have also identified that few people actually use these said apps. Therefore we would like to identify why that is the case. We have done so through conducting interviews with individuals within our target audience, and the result can be found in Section \ref{intRes}. We found that many people dislike existing app solutions due to them often not actually solving the problem of inconvenience and simply just changing the nature of the problem to having the app being tedious (by still requiring manual typing input)to use instead.

\section{Key Design Insights and Proposed Future States}

Based on the problem that we identified through our interviews, we proposed several features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Receipt Scanning/Parsing - Users will no longer need to type out an itemized version of their receipts, and this will save a significant amount of time and effort for them.
\item Integration with Android Pay/Apple Pay/other vendors to automatically detect their itemized payments, meaning users don't even need to input any data apart from how it will be split (if at all).
\item Adaptive behaviour - intelligently learn user's splitting habits over time, e.g. expenses named "Bill" (or e.g. images of an electricity bill) will automatically be split evenly with a group names "Flat".
\item Automatically and optimally calculating debt settling/transferring so that users have less people to worry about.
\item Paypay/Monzo integration - Allow users to settle debts easily, as well as request settlements from other users.
\end{itemize} 

We believe that with those features, as well as focusing on a simple and clean interface, would solve the problem that we identified eariler. We believe that the app that we produce would provide convenience for many young professionals that struggle to track their expenses currently.

\section{HCD Research Metthodology}

Throughout the project, we made sure to keep requesting our user panel for feedback. Before we started working, we also asked more general questions in regards to the nature of the problem statement.

\begin{itemize}
\item What are your thought on splitting bills and expenses? How do you currently deal with them? Are you frustrated by having to do this?
\item Have you ever used an app like this before? (after showing them one such app) What are your thoughts on it?
\item Do you think it has enough features? Is it intuitive enough?
\item Do you know friends/family that already use this, or would benefit from it?
\end{itemize} 

Given that the problem statement revolves around the (in)convenience and sluggish nature of splitting bills, we also prioritized on the UI giving users a clean and minimal experience in using the app, hence we continuously also asked users to try using the app and provide feedback on the app GUI and flow.

\subsection{Interview Response}
\label{intRes}
Below are the some of the response we had when interviewing people that have recently begun their professional careers.

\begin{itemize}
  \item â€˜We end up taking as much time to write down down the items and details of an expenseâ€™
  \item â€˜Iâ€™m still too lazy to do mental arithmetic.â€™
  \item â€˜Why do I have to enter the same details every time? I'm fed up with it.â€™
  \item 'Why is it so complicated to add a bill?'
  \item 'The app just is not easy to use, too many useless features that I don't need.'
  \item 'Sometimes my friends don't believe me when I tell them that they owe me. It is also very difficult when you tell your coworker that they owe you money.'
\end{itemize}

  \item Spends most of her time in work 
  \item Hates to spend time on inefficient unnecessary work
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ie. typing out the receipt manually on expense tracker apps
    \item Not a fan of having to do any arithmetic, even with a calculator
    \item Does not like the learning curve on how to use new apps/technology
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
  
Need/Pains: She likes to track her expenses, however,  she also finds current apps inconvenient -- heavily time consuming and cannot convince her friends to use it.

Her preference: Be able to easily track expenses without having to spend 5 minutes putting in details every time (preferably with the least amount of hassle)

\subsubsection{Persona 2}
Johnathan Ong
\vspace{-2ex}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 23 years old
  \item Recent graduate, currently working at large tech company
  \item Higher-than-average salary
  \item Still leading a student-lifestyle, despite graduating
  \item Nice guy who does no€™t mind paying for the group
\end{itemize}

Need/Pains:
He \emph{thinks} that he is losing a non-insignificant amount of money from losing track of the expenses and bills that he ha€™s paid for his friends

His preference: 
He would like to to know exactly which of his friends/coworkers owes him how much, and have a record of every time he ha€™s paid for/been paid for.

\subsection{Sample Interview Questions}
\vspace{-2ex}
\begin{itemize}
  \item How often do you split the bill with others, per week?
  \item Roughly, could you give us an idea of how much money each bill you split would cost you?
  \item How much money do you think you lose track of, per week?
  \item How much of monthly expenses are shared? How much is that relative to all your monthly expenses disregarding rent?
  \item If you had to split a bill with a group, how often would you be the one to volunteer to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pay for the group?
    \item Calculate the shares?
    \item Any particular reason why for the above?
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Interview Response}
\label{intRes}
Some commonly mentioned interview responses (Our target interviewees are young professionals): 

\begin{itemize}
  \item €˜"We end up taking as much time to write down down the items and details of an expense"
  \item €˜"Why do I have to enter the same details every time? I'm fed up with it."
  \item "I™m still too lazy to do mental arithmetic."
  \item "Why is it so complicated to add a bill?"
  \item "The app just is not easy to use, too many useless features that I don't need."
  \item "Sometimes my friends don't believe me when I tell them that they owe me. It is also very difficult when you tell your coworker that they owe you money."
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preliminary Feedback on Research Questions}
\label{feedback}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Focus on keeping it simple
  \item Too many features end up being clutter, even if theyâ€™re hidden away in the UI.
  \item Young Professionals are more considerate of their spendings and their shared expenses
Likely due to them being their own money they earn through work and not loans/parents.
  \item Nice guy who doesnâ€™t mind paying for the `group
  \item Most said they liked our mockups, but didnâ€™t care too much about advanced/detailed features.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Application Iteration 1}

In the first iteration, we introduced Login Page and Home page as well as an add transaction page, some very basic functionality for the app. The user mentioned that they like the simplicity in the design, especially in the Add Transaction page, they mentioned one point for improvement can be adding drop-down menus for the entry fields as well as default options, which can make their life easier while entering the transaction. They also mentioned that they very much look forward to the receipt scanning feature.

\subsection{Application Iteration 2}

We started implementing the receipt scanning feature as user requested in the previous iteration. However, that feature is not easy to implement, especially when trying to pick out all the items from the receipt one by one, that is especially time consuming. Therefore we decided to implement an easier version of the feature first, and see how the feedback is like on that feature before digging deeper into the more sophisticated aspect of this feature. The users liked this feature but they mentioned that they would also like the feature to be able to split out different items in the bill. They think that feature would be especially helpful when going grocery shopping for their friends but different people request different items. They also mentioned that they would like to see the picture that they took before the receipt processed, because they don't want to waste time requesting information from a blurred picture. They also mentioned that they would like easier navigation around the app, since the number of interfaces are getting greater, possibly a menu would be very good.

\subsection{Application Iteration 3}
We implemented the features that the user suggested in the previous iteration. The users are very impressed with the new features and they also made a couple more suggestions. One user mentioned that they would like to crop the picture after it has been taken, and possibly resize functionality as well. Another mentioned the UI design could be improved, especially with how the menu bar looks and where it is located.
